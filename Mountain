There is a mountain made entirely of diamond, a thousand miles wide and half again as tall. And at the base of the moutain, there is a man. A man...and a stone. And every day, at dawn, the man rises. He stands and he stretches, and he shakes off the sleep and lethargy and yesterday's aches and pains. And he gets to work. He strains, and screams, and beats his fists against the rock with effort, until the rock moves up the moutain. An inch, a centimeter, a yard...a hair. He feels it move. And so he sets his back again, to try, to strain, to nearly break with effort until that rock moves again. And again. Over and over again. And when night comes, he relaxes. He sets down and sleeps. And the rock rolls back down. And when the whole of the mountain is worn away, peak to foundation, he will look upon it. And he will go find another. Torment is terrible. The blades, and the flames, and the strain of it all. It hurts, and it's awful. It's hell. It's war. But what else am I supposed to be doing? What else but grinding down the mountain? Let me tell you a secret. This isn't my first mountain. --Sisyphus
