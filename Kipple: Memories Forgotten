What is the difference between a meaningful memory piece and junk? What makes something a memory worth keeping over rubbish that just...collects? I see people taking thousands of photos, but when do they look back? What is their purpose? I'm moving out of my parent's house now and I'm leaving with less than I brought at the beginning of the summer. I'm leaving behind all those memory pieces, some of which are meaningful to me and some to my parents, and many of the former will go into the bin. But I leave it anyway, because I wish to look forwards and not behind. But maybe there will someday be memories forgotten for lack of a reminder? Do I even want to keep those? I may as well be burning those items to the goddess of memory, to be lost in remembrance forever. Where do they go, these lost memoreis? And once they are lost, what becomes of their totems? Kipple: Memories forgotten.
