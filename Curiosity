Curiosity is hard. It's kind of difficult to be curious. Or rather, to stay curious. In a moment of wandering it's easy to wonder why, to wonder how, to wonder what. But such thoughts are just as easily dismissed, left to blow away on the wind like so many leaves, sand grains. Breaths. Much more difficult is to act on those wonderings, let yourself be moved by them to search, to find, or even harder...to not find. Children do this naturally, wending their way around endless meandering thoughts, following whichever threads fit their fancy only to drop them all to follow a new one. Perhaps this is because they are, for lack of a better term, unformed. To be moved they need not ask why, they just do. Why not? But to remain in place, following one idea to its end, eyes on the path instead of the horizon; they need a reason. At some point, this reverses. We calcify, petrify, harden our minds and set our stance, and suddenly to move needs reason and to remain in place becomes our standard. The wonderings still come--to be human is to be both an endless wellspring of mental noise and receptacle of the same--but we let them go unwandered. I will not go so far as to call this a universal mistake, but what I will say is that it is a mistake for me. Curiosity is a skill, and like any other it must be trained and cultivated. But it's hard, at times, to abandon the straight road and choose the meandering path, for no other reason than because it was noticed. It takes commitment, focus. Discipline. This, I suppose, is what I seek. The discipline to wander.
