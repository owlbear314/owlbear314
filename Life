The great tragedy of being human is not that you have only one life to live, but that you can only live it once. I would never want to be anyone else. Wouldn't want to live in any other time, or any other place. I could never ask to be anyone other than who I am, where I am, when I am, now. But if I could have three wishes...pause, rewind, undo.
