Love wants to be free. We put these constraints on it, but in the end they do nothing but hurt our bonds. The ancient Greeks had the right of it, with their many words for love. They understood, and it is reflected in their language, that lvoe comes in many forms. Ask anyone and everyone, if all the people they knew fell in a river, the order they would save them in. Most, I believe, will give the following: children, spouse/partner, parents, siblings, friends. And the reason for that order is not random, but nor is it cultural. It is evolutionary. It is predicated on genetic future that we should value those groups in that order. But for some reason we in our modern society have both separated those loves and decided to call them all the same. And so the word becomes constrained, and the concept muddled. Are our loves for friends less than for our partners? They should not be, but we are constrained to believe that they are, so much so that we cannot refer to friendship as "love" without hurting some people, or at the very least making certain gatherings quite awkward really fast. Our society is also based (mostly) on monogamy, but for some reason we have decided that should constrain our ability to love as well. You must love only one, can only choose one, and to love another while committing to the first is a sin. Not just wrong, but some moral wrong that ends up on the List of Ten Very Specific Things You Should Not Do By the Order Of the Big Head In The Clouds. But love wants to be free. And when you constrain something, you get less of it. No limits improve the objective. So why do we limit our love. At this point, our language limits it for us. And this Orwellian construct we have made for ourselves, well...we like it. Because those who follow or pretend to follow it can stand above those who do not. Someday, perhaps, after the fall or evolution of English, we will again have enough words to free love. Agape.
